    7. Then, you will see the option between "Espresso AI" and "Bigeye" â€” choose "Espresso AI".
    8. When you reach the 2FA/OTP prompt:
       - Call the generate_otp tool with service="rippling"
       - Enter the OTP code from the tool response into the 2FA field
       - Click "Verify" to complete authentication. If for some reason the OTP is not working, you can try again by calling the generate_otp tool once again.

    10. Look for a button labeled "Log in to your HSA account" and click on it. 
        This will open a new tab and after a few seconds, you will see a page with different benefit accounts (e.g. HSA, PKG, TRN, etc).
    11. It is possible that you instead see a page that prompts you to login again. 
        If this happens, exit the tab, and in the previous tab, click on the "Log in to your HSA account" button again so that you see the benefit accounts.
